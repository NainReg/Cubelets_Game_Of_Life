# Cubelets_Game_Of_Life
Flashlights cubelet programming process to play the game of life

The board is constructed with Cubelets Robots: first 9 flashlights (board of 3x3), then 25 (board of 5x5) and, finally 16 of these (board 4x4). Each change is 500 milliseconds. It is inspired by the Game of Life.

Each folder contains the codes used for the cubelets used. If you wish to use them, you must change the serial numbers according to your own arrangement. It is also important to be careful when placing them, otherwise inconsistent results will occur.

in each folder you will find:

codigosViborita. First test of how flashlights respond to interaction with their neighbors.

codigosTopePlaneador. Here's the glider codes for 25 cubelets. Note: it should work so the change is continuous and works as if the board were infinite, but in testing, it truncates at the walls.

codigosSapo. Here's the Toad codes for 16 cubelets.

codigosOscilador. Here's the blinker codes for 9 cubelets.

codigosFaro. Here's the beacon codes for 16 cubelets.

codigosEater. Here's the eater codes for 16 cubelets.

codigosCuadroSeis. Here's the codes for 16 cubelets of other combination.
